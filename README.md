## How To Play (Rules)
The numbers on the board represent how many bombs are adjacent to a square. For example, if a square has a "3" on it, then there are 3 bombs next to that square. The bombs could be above, below, right left, or diagonal to the square. Avoid all the bombs and expose all the empty spaces to win Minesweeper.
